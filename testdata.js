Contributions have also made by a host of others - Bob Bretzlaff, Nathan James, Joel Berry, and Jeremy White.\n\nThe members and contributors of WBAE have been working together in various combinations for many years, starting in Linden, MI with bands (in chronological order) Spork, Fat Souls, and Espers. Check out our older work here: http://wbae.co/fb\n\nPrior bands have focused on playing live shows, primarily in the Flint, MI area, but WBAE had been limited to being a songwriting and recording endeavor with Adam and Beren on opposite sides of the state of MI and Collin living in Japan.  Collin moved back to MI in late 2013 and rehearsals and preparations for live shows ensued.  Rock.\n\nThe recording process is completely DIY, with recording and mixing and mastering efforts being handled by Adam and Collin.","country":"United States","public_favorites_count":0,"followers_count":100,"followings_count":64,"plan":"Free","myspace_name":null,"discogs_name":null,"website_title":"Review (en fran\u00E7ais)","website":"http://mybandnews.com/2015/07/wildbearsattackelephants-keeai/","reposts_count":1,"comments_count":74,"online":false,"likes_count":0,"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000048373843-zizehe-large.jpg","id":52119028,"kind":"user","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/wildbearsattackelephants","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/52119028","username":"WildBearsAttackElephants","permalink":"wildbearsattackelephants","last_modified":"2016/02/19 13:28:10 +0000"}];
